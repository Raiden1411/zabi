## TypedDataDomain

EIP712 typed data domain. Spec is defined [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712)

### Properties

```zig
struct {
  chainId: ?u64 = null
  name: ?[]const u8 = null
  verifyingContract: ?[]const u8 = null
  version: ?[]const u8 = null
  salt: ?[]const u8 = null
}
```

## MessageProperty

EIP712 message property type. Spec is defined [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712)

### Properties

```zig
struct {
  name: []const u8
  type: []const u8
}
```

## EncodeTypeErrors

Set of possible errors when encoding struct into human-readable format.

```zig
Allocator.Error || error{InvalidPrimaryType}
```

## EIP712Errors

Set of possible errors when encoding the struct values.

```zig
EncodeTypeErrors || ParamErrors || error{ UnexpectTypeFound, NoSpaceLeft, InvalidLength }
```

## HashTypedData
Performs hashing of EIP712 according to the expecification
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712

`types` parameter is expected to be a struct where the struct
keys are used to grab the solidity type information so that the
encoding and hashing can happen based on it. See the specification
for more details.

`primary_type` is the expected main type that you want to hash this message.
Compilation will fail if the provided string doesn't exist on the `types` parameter

`domain` is the values of the defined EIP712Domain. Currently it doesnt not support custom
domain types.

`message` is expected to be a struct where the solidity types are transalated to the native
zig types. I.E string -> []const u8 or int256 -> i256 and so on.
In the future work will be done where the compiler will offer more clearer types
base on a meta programming type function.

**Example**
```zig
const domain: TypedDataDomain = .{
    .name = "Ether Mail",
    .version = "1",
    .chainId = 1,
    .verifyingContract = "0xCcCCccccCCCCcCCCCCCcCcCccCcCCCcCcccccccC",
};

const types = .{
    .EIP712Domain = &.{
        .{ .type = "string", .name = "name" },
        .{ .name = "version", .type = "string" },
        .{ .name = "chainId", .type = "uint256" },
        .{ .name = "verifyingContract", .type = "address" },
    },
    .Person = &.{
        .{ .name = "name", .type = "string" },
        .{ .name = "wallet", .type = "address" },
    },
    .Mail = &.{
        .{ .name = "from", .type = "Person" },
        .{ .name = "to", .type = "Person" },
        .{ .name = "contents", .type = "string" },
    },
};

const hash = try hashTypedData(testing.allocator, types, "Mail", domain, .{
    .from = .{
        .name = "Cow",
        .wallet = "0xCD2a3d9F938E13CD947Ec05AbC7FE734Df8DD826",
    },
    .to = .{
        .name = "Bob",
        .wallet = "0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB",
    },
    .contents = "Hello, Bob!",
});
```

### Signature

```zig
pub fn hashTypedData(
    allocator: Allocator,
    comptime types: anytype,
    comptime primary_type: []const u8,
    domain: ?TypedDataDomain,
    message: anytype,

    .verifyingContract = "0xCcCCccccCCCCcCCCCCCcCcCccCcCCCcCcccccccC",

In the future work will be done where the compiler will offer more clearer types
base on a meta programming type function.

Slices, arrays, strings and bytes will all be encoded as "bytes32" instead of their
usual encoded values.

### Signature

```zig
pub fn encodeStruct(
    allocator: Allocator,
    comptime types: anytype,
    comptime primary_type: []const u8,
    data: anytype,
    writer: anytype,

```

## HashType
Hash the main types and it's nested children

### Signature

```zig
pub fn hashType(
    allocator: Allocator,
    comptime types_fields: anytype,
    comptime primary_type: []const u8,
) EncodeTypeErrors![Keccak256.digest_length]u8
```

## EncodeType
Encodes the main type from a struct into a "human-readable" format.

*Ex: struct { Mail: []const struct {type: "address", name: "foo"}} into "Mail(address foo)"*

```zig
pub fn encodeType(
    allocator: Allocator,
    comptime types_fields: anytype,
    comptime primary_type: []const u8,

    comptime types_fields: anytype,
    comptime primary_type: []const u8,
    result: *std.StringArrayHashMap(void),
