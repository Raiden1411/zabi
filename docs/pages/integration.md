# Integrating ZAbi

### Zig Package Manager
In the `build.zig.zon` file, add the following to the dependencies object.

```zig
.zabi = .{
    .url = "https://github.com/Raiden1411/zabi/archive/VERSION_NUMBER.tar.gz",
}
```

The compiler will produce a hash mismatch error, add the `.hash` field to `build.zig.zon`
with the hash the compiler tells you it found.

You can also use `zig fetch` to automatically do the above steps.

```bash
zig fetch --save https://github.com/Raiden1411/zabi/archive/VERSION_NUMBER.tar.gz 
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/Raiden1411/zabi.git#LATEST_COMMIT
```

To install zabi with the latest zig version you can install it like so

```bash
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/Raiden1411/zabi.git#zig_version_0.14.0
```

Zabi will only maintain the latest version available. So when 0.15.0 eventually releases it use that and 0.14.0 will no longer be supported and so on.

This should only be until zig reaches 1.0.

Then in your `build.zig` file add the following to the `exe` section for the executable where you wish to have `zabi` available.

```zig
const zabi_module = b.dependency("zabi", .{}).module("zabi");
// for exe, lib, tests, etc.
exe.root_module.addImport("zabi", zabi_module);
```

Now in the code, you can import components like this:

```zig
const zabi = @import("zabi");
const meta = zabi.meta;
const encoder = zabi.encoder;
```

Zabi is a modular library meaning that you can import separete modules if you just need some components of zabi.

```zig
const zabi = b.dependency("zabi", .{});
// for exe, lib, tests, etc.
exe.root_module.addImport("zabi-evm", zabi.module("zabi-evm"));
```

Now in the code, you can import components like this:

```zig
const zabi_evm = @import("zabi-evm");
```

Currently these are all of the modules available for you to use in `zabi`:

- zabi -> contains all modules.
- zabi-abi -> contains all abi types and eip712.
- zabi-ast -> contains a solidity tokenizer, parser and Ast.
- zabi-clients -> contains all supported RPC clients and a block explorer clients. Also include a multicall clients as well as the wallet and contract client.
- zabi-crypto -> contains the signer used in zabi as well BIP32 and BIP39
- zabi-decoding -> contains all decoding methods supported.
- zabi-encoding -> contains all encoding methods supported.
- zabi-ens -> contains a custom ens client and utils.
- zabi-evm -> contains the EVM interpreter.
- zabi-human -> contains a custom human readable abi parser.
- zabi-meta -> contains all of the meta programming utils used in zabi.
- zabi-op-stack -> contains custom op-stack clients and utils.
- zabi-types -> contains all of the types used in zabi.
- zabi-utils -> contains all of the utils used in zabi as well as the custom cli parser data generator.
