## TypedDataDomain

## MessageProperty

## HashTypedData
Performs hashing of EIP712 according to the expecification
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712
`types` parameter is expected to be a struct where the struct
keys are used to grab the solidity type information so that the
encoding and hashing can happen based on it. See the specification
for more details.\
`primary_type` is the expected main type that you want to hash this message.\
Compilation will fail if the provided string doesn't exist on the `types` parameter
`domain` is the values of the defined EIP712Domain. Currently it doesnt not support custom
domain types.\
`message` is expected to be a struct where the solidity types are transalated to the native
zig types. I.E string -> []const u8 or int256 -> i256 and so on.\
In the future work will be done where the compiler will offer more clearer types
base on a meta programming type function.

## HashStruct
Performs hashing of EIP712 structs according to the expecification

`data` is expected to be a struct where the solidity types are transalated to the native
zig types. I.E string -> []const u8 or int256 -> i256 and so on.\

## EncodeStruct
Performs encoding of EIP712 structs according to the expecification
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712
`types` parameter is expected to be a struct where the struct
keys are used to grab the solidity type information so that the
encoding and hashing can happen based on it. See the specification

`data` is expected to be a struct where the solidity types are transalated to the native
zig types. I.E string -> []const u8 or int256 -> i256 and so on.\
In the future work will be done where the compiler will offer more clearer types
base on a meta programming type function.\
Slices, arrays, strings and bytes will all be encoded as "bytes32" instead of their
usual encoded values.

## EncodeStructField
Encodes a singular struct field.

## HashType
Hash the main types and it's nested children

## EncodeType
Encodes the main type from a struct into a "human-readable" format.\
*Ex: struct { Mail: []const struct {type: "address", name: "foo"}} into "Mail(address foo)"*

## FindTypeDependencies
Finds the main type child type and recursivly checks their children as well.
